My name is Lu√≠s Duarte, and i'm a Software Engineer who enjoys writing code, software architecture and making the impossible possible. I like *nix operating systems, as they provide me with all the freedom a Software Engineer wants.

I consider myself a Polyglot Programmer since i don't like to be stuck with one specific language and a DIY enthusiast.
